## Doctor Module 

The Doctor module in the Doctor Appointment App involves key information for effective functionality. During signup, doctors provide their name, email, and a password. They also add details like their medical specialty and a short description about themselves.

Once registered, doctors can manage their profiles by displaying their name, specialty, and a brief bio. They can update this information when needed.

In Slot Management, doctors can add, view, and delete slots. Each slot includes details like hospital name, timing, and a unique Slot ID, helping doctors manage their availability.

For Patient Management, doctors can view a list of patients and their details, including names and appointment history. This helps doctors keep track of patient interactions.

## Patient Module 

The Patient module in the Doctor Appointment App simplifies the healthcare journey for users. Patients register with a unique username, email, and password. Once logged in, the patient dashboard presents different doctor categories to choose from.

Patients can explore available doctors within specific categories, select a preferred doctor, and view their available time slots. When booking an appointment, patients choose a convenient time, enter their details, and confirm the appointment. The system allows patients to have a user-friendly experience in scheduling and managing multiple appointments, if needed.

The module also offers a appointment history section. Patients can effortlessly track their past and upcoming appointments, gaining insights into their healthcare journey. Overall, the Patient module ensures a seamless and accessible healthcare experience within the Doctor Appointment App.
